# In this page we have set up some user stories.

These are used to determine what should be implemented into our application.

## In the case of our idea for our application, we define a user as someone who:
- **is an IT specialist**
- **Uses different online services**
- **Wants these different services centralized in an easy overview. (Thus a dashboard)**
